# Phase 2 Project


## Project Overview

This project is using  provided data to come up with a model that predicts houses  that have at least the similar variables.


### The Data

I picked my data, kc_house_data as I wanted to analyze the problem using profit and other variables that are common in most houses such as bedrooms, number of bathrooms and the size of the living room. 
The variable profit is determined by the other variables which  the model would use to predict other house prices.


### Business Problem

Zamani Real Estate have been contracted by different property owners to assist them in selling their houses. They have given me past data of houses sold which i will use to create a model that predicts the price of a house that is to be put on sale


## Conclusion

From the data, sqft_living is the most correlated variable with price followed by grade and bathrooms.
 For a developer, they can maximize on the variables while building a new house in order to sell at a higher price.
